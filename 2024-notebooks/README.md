There are three half days of practicals.
We are aware that there is a diversity of skillsets, hence we have a range of exercises.
Majorly, there is a review presentation on Friday were you present a slide or two on a finding of your choice.

The material can be found at https://github.com/matteoferla/DTC-compchem-practical/
specifically in the [2024 folder](https://github.com/matteoferla/DTC-compchem-practical/tree/main/2024-notebooks).

## Notebook overview
The tutorials are in the form of Jupyter notebooks,
specifically Google Colab notebooks, which are run in the cloud, so you don't need to install anything.

> Confused about the difference between a Jupyter notebook and a Colab notebook? [See note](about_notebooks.md).

These notebooks run in Colab. They are intended to be run in order during the lab session.
If you have Jupyter installed, you can run them locally.

A GitHub ipynb can be run in Colab by appending
to https://colab.research.google.com/github
the following path `<USERNAME>/<REPO>/blob/<BRANCH>/<PATH>.ipynb`.

Branch by default is now `main`, but `master` in older repos.

## Aims
Aim: To learn, not win prizes or go home early: 
**Please do not press `Run all`.**
It utterly defeats the point of the practical.
