    "There are different implementation, as there are three flavours of notebook: vanilla jupyter, jupyter lab and colab. These interact w/ JS differently Blog post I wrote about the boring technicalities: https://blog.matteoferla.com/2022/05/js-in-colab.html\n",

    " I made a version that works in Colab and in vanilla Jupyter.\n",
    " A software team made a widget which can be used in labs â€”even if they are using someone's code they have their logo on it, which is rather rotten IMO. It is easy to monkeypatch to remove the logo but that would be more rotten still. :laugh:"
