## Notebook overview

> Confused about the difference between a Jupyter notebook and a Colab notebook? [See note](about_notebooks.md).

These notebooks run in Colab. They are intended to be run in order:

* Reading while installing: [theory](theory.md) — Overview of molecular mechanics
* Intro to RDKit: [![colab demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Run_RDKit_intro-f9ab00?logo=googlecolab)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/matteoferla/DTC-compchem-practical/blob/main/1-basics.ipynb) — Overview of RDKit functionality
