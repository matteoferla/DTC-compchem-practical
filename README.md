> WIP. I will add notebooks for 2024 shortly

## Notebook overview

> Confused about the difference between a Jupyter notebook and a Colab notebook? [See note](about_notebooks.md).

These notebooks run in Colab. They are intended to be run in order during the lab session.

A GitHub ipynb can be run in Colab by appending
to https://colab.research.google.com/github
the following path `<USERNAME>/<REPO>/blob/<BRANCH>/<PATH>.ipynb`.

Branch by default is now `main`, but `master` in older repos.

Aim: To learn, not win prizes or go home early: 
**Please do not press `Run all`.**
It utterly defeats the point of the practical.
