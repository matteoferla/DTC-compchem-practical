    "For the analysis, we will use fragment screen data from [Fragalysis](https://fragalysis.diamond.ac.uk/),\n",
    "the app that provides an interface to the various datasets in XChem, prof Frank von Delft's group at Diamond.\n",
    "For what is what consult [this table](https://github.com/matteoferla/munged-Fragalysis-targets/blob/main/targets.md).\n",
    "In this practical we will be using it for the data, but you are welcome to explore it.\n",
    "You will be shown it properly in the Diamond visit.\n",
    "Additionally, a key idea is fragment binding sites are no way of equal important to a researcher,\n",
    "i.e. designing an inhibitor for an enzyme requires knowledge of where and how catalysis occurs.\n",
    "This is also beyond the scope of this practical but worth keeping in mind."
